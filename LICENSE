    LICENSE

 

1.1. Subject to Licensee’s payment of the applicable fees and to

Licensee’s compliance with other terms and conditions of this Agreement,

Indigo Geeks grants Licensee a non-transferable, non-assignable,

non-sublicensable, worldwide license to copy the Software for the

purposes, in accordance with the Software’s technical documentation and

solely during the periods and on the maximum number of Designated

URLs specified in one or more applicable Indigo Geeks or

Indigo Geeks-authorized reseller ordering schedules (the “Indigo Geeks Order

Form”) executed with Licensee.

 

1.2. In the event that Licensee’s actual number of URLs of a

particular Software license exceeds the licensed number of Designated

URLs on such license, Licensee shall promptly provide Indigo Geeks with

written notice and pay Indigo Geeks the fees required to license such

additional URL(s) in accordance with the commercial terms set out in

the Indigo Geeks Order Form.

 

1.3. Licensee shall implement reasonable controls to ensure that it does

not exceed the maximum number of licensed URLs of the Software.

licensed number of URLs.

 

1.4. Indigo Geeks shall provide to Licensee an initial copy of the Software,

including the associated technical documentation, for use by Licensee in

accordance with this Agreement. Subject to Sections 1.1-1.3 above,

Licensee is authorized to make a reasonable number of non-URL copies

of the Software, e.g., onto a local pc, as it requires for purpose of

exercising its rights under this Agreement.

 

1.5. Licensee is authorized to use the Software on a single substitute

or backup URL on a temporary basis without charge any time a

Designated URL is inoperative due to a malfunction beyond the control

of Licensee. Licensee may transfer the Software on a permanent basis to

a single replacement URL without charge. Licensee agrees to provide

Indigo Geeks with written notice, including the URL type and operating

system, of any such transfer to a backup or replacement URL within

five (5) days thereafter.

 

1.6. Licensee acknowledges that portions of the Software are also freely

available to the public under Indigo Geeks’s open source version of the

Software, known as Indigo Geeks Community Edition, subject to certain

conditions, with limited warranties and other limited assurances, and

without service or support. As an express condition for the license

granted hereunder, Licensee agrees that any use during the term of this

Agreement of such open source versions of the Software, whether in a

Production URL Instance or a Non-Production URL Instance, shall be

deemed use of the Software for purposes of the calculation of fees

payable under the Agreement.

 

1.7. Indigo Geeks also grants Licensee the right to modify and create

derivative works of the Software. Licensee may contribute the rights in

any of those derivative works back to Indigo Geeks. Licensee may contact

distribute, perform, and display any derivative works of the Software

4.1. Indigo Geeks (or its third party providers) retains title to all

portions of the Software and other Proprietary Materials and any copies

thereof. The Proprietary Materials contain valuable proprietary

information, and Licensee shall not disclose them to anyone other than

those of its employees or consultants under written nondisclosure

obligations at least as restrictive as those contained in this

Agreement, having a need to know for purposes consistent with this

Agreement. Licensee shall be responsible for the compliance of such

employees or consultants. Licensee shall affix, to each full or partial

source software which is governed by the applicable license terms

thereof. A list of such open source software, as amended from time to

time, including the links applicable to such open source software is

specified in the product software bundled within the Software, and the

Software is subject to the provisions of such license agreements, and in

the event of any contradiction between the provisions of this Agreement

and the provisions of such applicable license agreement, the provisions

of the applicable open source license agreement shall prevail solely

with respect to such open source software products.

 

4.3. If the Software is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of

the U.S. Government (the “Government”), the Government agrees that such

Product is “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer

software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement to the

contrary, the Government’s rights with respect thereto are limited by

the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to applicable FAR and/or DFARS and

successor regulations.

 

    PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITY

 

Subject to the limitations in Section 8, for such time as Licensee is

that Licensee’s reproduction of the Software (which, for the purposes of

this Section 5, means the Software as delivered by Indigo Geeks, excluding

the open source software programs described in Section 4.2) as permitted

in this Agreement directly infringes such third party’s United States

requirements of this Section. Licensee will (a) provide Indigo Geeks prompt

written notice of any claim that the Software infringes any intellectual

property rights, (b) provide Indigo Geeks with all information and assistance

requested of it with respect to any such claim, and (c) offer Indigo Geeks

claims.

believes a court may hold that the Software, infringes the intellectual

property rights of any third party, Indigo Geeks may (but is not obligated

to), in its sole discretion, do any of the following: obtain for

Licensee the right to continue using the Software, replace or modify the

Software so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially

equivalent performance or, accept return of the Software, terminate this

Agreement, and refund Licensee an amount equal to the license fees paid

to Indigo Geeks multiplied by the percentage of the term of the license for

the Software that Licensee did not enjoy due to the early termination by

Indigo Geeks.

 

Indigo Geeks shall have no liability or obligation under this Agreement to

the extent the alleged infringement is based on (i) a modification or

derivative work of the Software developed by anyone other than Indigo Geeks;

(ii), a combination of the Software with any product or service not

provided by Indigo Geeks; (iii) use of the Software with one or more URLs

not listed in a Indigo Geeks Order Form; (iv) use of the Software other than

in accordance with this Agreement or the documentation; (v) indirect or

willful infringement; or (vi) any open source code, as described in

Section 4.2.

 

This Section 5 states Indigo Geeks’s entire liability and Licensee’s

exclusive remedy for any infringement related to the Software.

6.1. An event of default shall be deemed to occur if: (i) Licensee fails

to perform any of its obligations under the Sections entitled “License

Exclusions” or “Title and Protection”; (ii) Licensee fails to pay

amounts due pursuant to its agreement to the fees and payment terms in

Section 3 of this Agreement within seven (7) days of the relevant due

date; or (iii) either party fails to perform any other material

obligation under this Agreement and such failure remains uncured for

more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof.

(click-through) agreement, which Licensee may have accepted in

    GENERAL

 

This Agreement is made in and shall be governed by the laws of the State

the application of the law of another jurisdiction. All proceedings

shall be conducted in English. Venue for all proceedings shall be Santa

Clara County, California, provided that Indigo Geeks may seek injunctive

    DEFINITIONS

 

“Designated URL” shall mean the URL specified in a Indigo Geeks Order

Form with respect to a particular Software license. Such URL may be

that of a third-party under nondisclosure obligations that will host the

Software for the benefit of Licensee.

 

“Modifications” means any code developed by Licensee or any third party,

including without limitation, configuration, integrations,

implementations, or localizations to the external layer of the core,

baseline Software product. The term “Modifications” excludes Updates.

 

“Proprietary Material” means the Software, related documentation, and

all parts, copies and modifications thereof, and any other information,

in whatever form, received by Licensee hereunder, provided, however,

such information shall not be deemed Proprietary Material if it (a) is

or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of

Licensee; or (b) was in Licensee’s lawful possession prior to the

disclosure and had not been obtained by Licensee from Indigo Geeks; or (c) is

lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party without restriction on

disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by Licensee without

reference to or use of Indigo Geeks’s Proprietary Material.

instance of the Software is accessed and used either for production

purposes (“Production URL Instance”) or for non-production purposes,

such as development, testing, training and other non-operational

business transactions (“Non-Production URL Instance”). For example,

if one server contains two (2) instances of the Software, i.e., one

Production URL Instance and one Non-Production URL Instance, then

a URL license is required for each of such instances; development

in-house and by third-party consultants requires licenses for two

    SUBCONTRACTORS Indigo Geeks or its authorized resellers reserve the right

to subcontract any or all of the work to be performed under these

Support Terms, and Indigo Geeks retains responsibility for any work so

subcontracted.

 

    LICENSEE RESPONSIBILITIES Licensee shall provide commercially

reasonable cooperation and full information to Indigo Geeks or its authorized

resellers with respect to the furnishing of Support Services under this

Agreement.

 

    SUPPORT CONTACTS Licensee shall designate one or more support

contacts that are authorized to submit Software problems. If Licensee

has purchased the license from a Indigo Geeks-authorized reseller, Licensee

shall contact that party for assistance. If Licensee has purchased the

license directly from Indigo Geeks, Licensee may contact Indigo Geeks on the Site

or at its toll-free Support telephone number.

 

    PROBLEM PRIORITY Upon receipt of a properly submitted Software

problem, as specified on the Site or its authorized reseller shall

prioritize it in accordance with the guidelines below:

 

    Priority 1 (P1) – A P1 is a catastrophic production problem within

the Software that severely impacts the Licensee’s Production URL

Instance, or because of which Licensee’s Production URL Instance is

down or not functioning, or that results in a loss of production data

and no work around exists. P1 problems must be reported on Indigo Geeks’s

toll-free support telephone number in order to expedite resolution.

Indigo Geeks will use continuous efforts during its normal hours of

operation, with appropriate escalation to senior management, to provide

a resolution for any P1 problem as soon as is commercially reasonable.

 

    Priority 2 (P2) – A P2 is a problem within the Software where the

Licensee’s system is functioning but in a reduced capacity, or the

Problem is causing significant impact to portions of the Licensee’s

business operations and productivity, or the Software is exposed to

potential loss or interruption of service. Problems existing in a

non-production environment that would otherwise qualify as a P1 if they

were in a production system qualify as P2. Indigo Geeks will use r easonable

efforts during its normal hours of operation to provide a resolution for

any P2 problem as soon as is commercially reasonable.

 

    Priority 3 (P3) – A P3 is a medium-to-low impact problem that

involves partial and/or non-critical loss of functionality, or that

impairs some operations but allows Licensee’s operations to continue to

function. Problems for which there is limited or no loss or

functionality or impact to Licensee’s operation and for which there is

an easy work-around qualify as P3. Indigo Geeks will use reasonable efforts

during its normal hours of operation to provide a resolution for any P3

problem in time for the next minor release of the Software.

 

    Priority 4 (P4) – A P4 is for a general usage question or issue that

may be cosmetic in nature or documentation related, but the Software

works without interruption. Indigo Geeks will use reasonable efforts during

its normal hours of operation to provide a resolution for any P4 problem

in time for the next major release of the Software.

 

    Enhancement Request (ER) – An ER is a recommendation for future

product enhancement or modification to add official support and

documentation for unsupported or undocumented feature, or features that

do not exist in the Software. Indigo Geeks will take ERs into consideration

in the product management process, but has no obligation to deliver

enhancements based on any ER.

commercially reasonable efforts to meet the response times specified
